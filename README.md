gitary
======
A diary....err life tracking application.  The idea is to easily and quickly log information to a file based on a date.  Each edit is commited to a git repo.  This way we have a log of all changes and the option to add extra files.

Usage
=====
* edit : edit todays files
* -d : set a date for the file to edit
* -m : add text to the end of the file
* search : regex search through all files
* -h : help?
